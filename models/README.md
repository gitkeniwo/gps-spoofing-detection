`models/` contains separated code of classes and function to implement detection models we covered in this repo.

To use in your notebook, suppose you have your notebook under `notebooks/` dir:
```python
import sys
sys.path.add("..") # add parent folder to sys.path

from models.specific_model import specific_class
```
